 	    <legend> Variable Scope in Javascript</legend>
Scope refers to the availability of variables and functions in certain parts of the code.
<br><br>
In JavaScript, a variable has two types of scope:
<br><br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1)Global Scope<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2)Local Scope

<br><br><br>
<h3>GLOBAL SCOPE</h3>
A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.<br>

Let's see an example of a global scope variable.<br><br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/XX6QbK7/Capture.png" alt="Capture" border="0"><br>
<br>In the above program, variable a is declared at the top of a program and is a global variable. It means the variable a can be used anywhere in the program.
<br><br>The value of a global variable can be changed inside a function. For example,<br><br>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pyLnmXW/image-2021-11-01-183617.png" alt="image-2021-11-01-183617" border="0"><br><br>
In the above program, variable a is a global variable. The value of a is hello. Then the variable a is accessed inside a function and the value changes to 3.

Hence, the value of a changes after changing it inside the function.<br><br>
<fieldset class="sd">
 	    <legend>Note</legend>
 It is a good practice to avoid using global variables because the value of a global variable can change in different areas in the program. It can introduce unknown results in the program.</fieldset>
<br><br>

  In JavaScript, a variable can also be used without declaring it. If a variable is used without declaring it, that variable automatically becomes a global variable.
<br><br><br>
<h3>LOCAL SCOPE</h3>
A variable with local scope can only be accessed within the function.<br><br> 
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mJsr2Xw/image-2021-11-01-185532.png" alt="image-2021-11-01-185532" border="0"><br><br>
In the above program, variable a is a global variable and variable b is a local variable. The variable b can be accessed only inside the function greet. Hence, when we try to access variable b outside of the function, an error occurs.
<br><br><br>
<h3>BLOCK SCOPED VARIABLES</h3>
If a variable is declared in a block using let, then the variable can't be accessed outside the block.<br>For example,<br><br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KLjcMKZ/image-2021-11-01-190730.png" alt="image-2021-11-01-190730" border="0"><br><br>
In the above program, variable
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa is a global variable. It can be accessed anywhere in the program.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspb is a local variable. It can be accessed only inside the function greet.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspc is a block-scoped variable. It can be accessed only inside the if statement block.<br><br>
Hence, in the above program, the first two console.log() work without any issue.

However, we are trying to access the block-scoped variable c outside of the block in the third console.log(). This will throw an error.
